<point name="func_instance" box="-8 -8 -8 8 8 8">
An automatically updated prefab. Set Filename to the name of a .map containing geometry and/or entities you'd like to duplicate at various locations in this map. Position and orient this func_instance in any way you like, and on compile the map referenced herein will be collapsed into this map. Use for common architectural elements, repetitive entity configurations, building on grid but positioning off grid while maintaining ease of editing, etc.

Keys:
<real3 key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">This entity's orientation.</real3>
<string key="targetname" name="Fixup Name">A name that will, depending on the fixup style, be prepended or appended to any entities. If a Fixup Style is set, but a Fixup Name is not provided, an automatically generated name will be used. Keep in mind that even with fixup enabled and a name set, you can selectively avoid fixup by giving entities names starting with the @ symbol.</string>
<string key="file" name="Filename">A path, relative to the current map file's location, pointing to the map you'd like to copy in.</string>
<integer key="fixup_style" name="Fixup Style">The method by which entity names will be fixed up. Default 0.
0 = Prefix
1 = Postfix
2 = None
</integer>

<string key="replace01" name="Replace">A replacement parameter that takes the form of $variable value. For example, set this field to $brightness 750 and any occurrence of $brightness inside the Filename map will be replaced with 750 when the instances are collapsed.</string>
<string key="replace02" name="Replace">Materials can also be replaced, with #. For example, setting a replacement variable to #SKY1 DOPEFISH will retexture any surfaces in the Filename map, replacing the classic purple sky with everyone's favorite goofy fish.</string>
<string key="replace03" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace04" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace05" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace06" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace07" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace08" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace09" name="Replace"></string>
<string key="replace10" name="Replace">If you need more than ten replacements, don't forget you can add keys manually: replace11, replace12, etc.</string>
